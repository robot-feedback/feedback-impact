## ðŸ’» System Setup

### NAO Setup

1. Follow this [Documentation](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-8/family/nao_user_guide/index.html) to `Turn On` your NAO robot.

2. Create a conda environment using `python 2.7`. Nao python SDK isn't compatible with other python versions.

    ```
    conda create -n nao python=2.7
    conda activate nao
    ```
3. Install necessary packages in the `nao` environment

    ```
    pip install -r nao_requirements.txt
    ```

### NaoQi Installation

1. Download NaoQi Python SDK from: https://www.aldebaran.com/en/support/nao-6/downloads-softwares. Rename the SDK with a short name -- e.g. `python-sdk`. Check the following image for `ubuntu` system.

3. Set the following `path-variables` in the `nao` environment to install NaoQi. First, activate the `nao` environment and then run the following commands in the terminal one by one.

    ```
    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}: /<path-to-python-sdk>/lib/python2.7/site-packages 
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}: /<path-to-python-sdk>/lib
    export QI_SDK_PREFIX= /<path-to-python-sdk>/
    ```



### LLM Environment Setup

1. Create a conda environment using `python 3.x`. OpenAI API requires `python 3.x`

    ```
    conda create -n feedback python=3.10
    conda activate feedback
    ```
2. Install necessary packages in the `feedback` environment

    ```
    pip install -r feedback_requirements.txt
    ```

### Quickstart
1. Activate the two conda environments - `nao`, `feedback` in two different terminals.

2. In `nao` terminal run `nao_client.py`. Before that write your nao `robot_ip` in the code.
    ```
    python nao_client.py
    ```

3. In `feedback` terminal run the task code. For the `promotion_task.py` connect a camera with your laptop.
    ```
    python prevention_task.py
    ```
