Global warming has become one of the most debated issues in today’s world. Rising sea levels and melting icecaps are threatening many coastal areas. Some scientists argue that if temperatures continue to rise, the impact could be catastrophic. People living in these regions may be forced to migrate, losing their homes and livelihoods. Furthermore, governments do not take consistent actions to reduce emissions. Renewable energy, like wind and solar, offers solutions, but their adoption remains slow. However, it’s important we address this crisis immediately. Failure to act affects not only the environment, but also economic growth and global stability in the near future.
