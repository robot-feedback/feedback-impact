The rise of social media has changed how we communicate with one another. People from different backgrounds share their experiences online, creating a global network of information. However, this also leads to an increase in misinformation and fake news. Governments across the globe try to combat these issues, but some countries don’t prioritize them. Schools and universities need to teach students how to critically evaluate sources. Additionally, companies that rely on digital platforms must ensure their users’ privacy is protected. If these problems aren’t addressed, the consequences could be severe, impacting both individuals and societies as a whole.
