In the modern world, people rely heavily on technology for their daily tasks. Computers and mobile devices have become an integral part of life. However, the overuse of these devices leads to several problems, including a decrease in face-to-face interactions and productivity. Studies show that individuals who spend too much time on screens often develop health issues, like eye strain and sleep disorders. Schools and workplaces should implement policies to manage technology usage. Additionally, some companies fail to protect their employees' privacy. Governments need to play an active role in promoting awareness, but many countries do not prioritize these growing concerns.
