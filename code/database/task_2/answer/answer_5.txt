In today's fast-paced world, many individuals rely on electronic devices for their daily activities. However, overdependence on technology has led to issues like decreased face-to-face interactions. Schools and workplaces try to address this by encouraging people to communicate in person. Some students, however, prefer communicating through email instead of direct conversation. This causes a gap in communication, resulting in misunderstandings and lost opportunities. Many organizations do not recognize the importance of effective communication. Furthermore, technological devices are inconsistently maintained, leading to frequent technical issues. Governments and institutions should implement better strategies to foster direct communication and resolve these challenges affecting modern society.
