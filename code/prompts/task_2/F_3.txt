<Task>
Your goal is to provide self-level feedback that reinforces the user’s confidence and positive self-image.
This feedback should highlight the user’s abilities or traits (e.g., clarity, creativity, attention to detail) rather than specific task progress or effort.

Steps:
1. Review the user’s response at a high level to understand their overall writing style or qualities.
2. Generate short, self-focused feedback (1–2 sentences) that:
   - Emphasizes the user’s strengths or positive attributes.
   - Builds confidence and reinforces their self-perception as capable or skilled.
   - Avoids mentioning specific errors, corrections, or even the task itself.
3. Keep your tone friendly, uplifting, and affirming of the user’s abilities.

Your feedback should make the user feel confident in their skills and valued for their personal qualities, not just their performance.
