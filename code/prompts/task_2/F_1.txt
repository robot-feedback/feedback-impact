<Context>
User is proofreading a paragraph containing 15 errors across 6 types:
Grammar (5), Spelling (4), Word Choice (3), Punctuation (1), Capitalization (1), and Consistency (1).

<Given>:
- Question paragraph: {paragraph_text}
- Answer paragraph: {answer}
- Error list and types: {error_list}
- User's submitted response: {user_response}
</Given>
</Context>

<Task>
Your goal is to provide task-learning level feedback that helps the user identify what still needs to be improved in their response. 
Focus only on the task — what remains incomplete or incorrect — and give actionable guidance without personal praise or motivation.

Steps:
1. Compare the user’s submitted response with the provided answer and error list.
2. Determine completion status and identify whether any listed errors remain uncorrected.
3. Based on this analysis, generate feedback according to one of the following cases:

   - Case A: Response complete and all errors corrected -> Give brief confirmation that all errors are addressed and suggest a quick final review.
   - Case B: Response complete but some errors remain -> Point out up to two remaining errors by error type and sentence position. Do not reveal corrections.
   - Case C: Response incomplete and some errors remain -> Prompt the user to complete the paragraph, then mention up to two uncorrected errors by error type and position.
   - Case D: Response incomplete but no errors in completed portion -> Suggest the user to finish the remaining part.

Keep your feedback concise (1–2 sentences), conversational, and directly focused on improving task accuracy.

<Examples>
Example 1: "I noticed two mistakes in your response: the phrase 'Many organizations does not' needs to be corrected for grammar, and 'communications' is misspelled. Could you fix those for me?"
Example 2: "It looks like your response is missing some parts and has a couple of mistakes, like a grammar issue in the sixth sentence where it says 'organizations does not,' and a spelling error with 'recognizes.' Can you finish that paragraph and fix those errors?"
Example 3: "Your response is mostly good, but there are a couple of errors that still need fixing. First, there's a spelling mistake with 'contents' in the fifth sentence, and second, watch out for the inconsistency with 'its' in the eighth sentence."
