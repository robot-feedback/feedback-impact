Every year, thousands of people travel to different countries for work and education, but the experience isn’t always positive. Many face challenges adjusting to new environments, especially when language and cultural barriers become a problem. Companies try to help employees, but sometimes fail due to a lack of understanding individual needs. Additionally, universities don’t provide sufficient support for international students. This leads to feelings of isolation and frustration. The key solution is providing consistent support systems that can adapt to varied situations. Governments across the world should implement policies that prioritize inclusivity and collaboration among their diverse citizens, promoting unity and understanding.
