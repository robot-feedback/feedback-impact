The fast development of technology has changed many aspects of our lives. We are dependent on devices that make living easier and more convenient. However, this reliance also brings problems. Some argue that too much use of smartphones affects our social skills. This is particularly evident in younger generations who seem more focused on their screens than the real world. Additionally, there are many apps, like weather or news, that provide us useful information. Yet, we donâ€™t always check the sources accurately. Consistently using unverified information might lead to misinformation, which is a growing concern in modern society, affecting trust and decision-making.
